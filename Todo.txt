To do:
  1) DONE Make sure that program properly uses gpu to make training faster 
    - Everyone during meeting
  2) Plot using tensors in pytorch instead of the for loop and regular arrays
    - Ask Kristin?
  3) DONE Use a function to define the function the neural network will be dealing with
    - Juwan
  4) DONE Clean up existing code with functions and global variables
    - Rachel and Juwan

  5) Fix plot with array instead of for loop (linspace??)
  6) Use a for loop to build n layers of the neural network (Lannon said it wasn't a sin in this case)
  7) x^2 cos y
  8) read transformer paper
